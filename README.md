<h1>Ncrypt</h1>
<h5>Ncrypt is block-chain protected, advanced proof of work application, which can be utilized for claiming the copyrights and patent-ship  of your works or creations. <br/><h3>Problems with current ways</h3>
Currently patents are protected either by the means of papers or as digital assets . If we take the case  of both , both of the ways are costlier and lacks security . Of course the non-digital ways are secure and do not need any protection regarding cyber attacks, but these has to be protected physically and governments  has to spend huge money protecting them and these are not the ways of future or present, due to lack of easy navigation ,storing etc .  And when we take the case of storing them as digital assets in web2, surely they are viable to cyber attacks and there is a good possibility these might be lost in the future, which is unbearable by the makers who created them. 

<br/><br/>
Well here's where encrypt comes in , by utilizing the security of blockchain we are planning to protect these patent and copy Right documents. The Ncrypt is gonna be a web3 app that stores the metadata in Polygon blockchain (cheapest of available blockchains in terms of gas fee) and uses IPFS (Inter Planetary File System, this is decentralized storage platform) to store files.

<br/>
  <h3>Business Model</h3>
  <br/>
In terms of feasibility  we are gonna charge a small amount which will be less than 10% of current charge of taking copyrights or patents , this is more than enough to make a profitable company out of it. Since we don't have any fee for security or any other kind there is almost zero expense from our side, making it more profitable.
